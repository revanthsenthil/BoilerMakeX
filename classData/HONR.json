Our food habits are also clear signals about our belonging to particular communities and culture groups.   And because these systems of norms, beliefs, and social connections that are expressed in our foodways are always changing, our concepts of what is \u201cgood to eat\u201d are constantly evolving as well. In this course, we will explore the many ways that food is an evolving idea in human societies.

This course will begin by exploring the implications of that impossibility, revisiting the origins of cinema, and understanding the earliest responses of moviegoers. How did people come to distinguish the cinematic medium from other art forms that preceded it? In other words, how is cinematic vision different from the painter\u2019s or the photographer\u2019s vision? What is unique about the way in which films tell stories? The history of film itself is full of dramatic twists and turns: from silent to sound, from black and white to color, from nascent editing tricks to the implausibility of CGI images. However, what these exponential developments in film technology don\u2019t explain are the politics latent in different cinematic genres, the meanings created by different camera movements, our motivations for creating celebrity cults, or even our fetish for CGI images. These are some of the directions through which we will explore \u201cFilm,\u201d and end, perhaps, with asking what the futures of cinema might look like., This course is for first year honors college students only.

We often mean this question metaphorically, but our literal place in the world \u2013 the spaces we inhabit, the built environment around us, and even the ways we think about space \u2013 influences us in profound ways. Insights from geospatial analysis are sometimes amazing: for example, the 1854 map of cholera outbreak made by Dr. John Snow in London led him to hypothesize that the disease spread through contaminated public water sources. However, spatial data can also be used to create inequalities within society, such as gerrymandering, redlining, and the colonial practice of partitioning cultural groups.", "Classes": []}, {"Id": "dc6b15c8-bb45-41b6-8cfa-eec35fa748d0", "Number": "29500", "SubjectId": "a003a9c9-9484-462e-a546-fba3eb2b0470", "Title": "Cultural Awareness/Study Away", "CreditHours": 1.0, "Description": "", "Classes": []}, {"Id": "dcd9f428-ca85-445a-baa8-fdc288a7143b", "Number": "22200", "SubjectId": "a003a9c9-9484-462e-a546-fba3eb2b0470", "Title": "Solutions Lab Global: Italy", "CreditHours": 2.0, "Description": "", "Classes": [{"Id": "c26b2d11-89d0-43a6-823e-efa348e7b6bc", "CourseId": "dcd9f428-ca85-445a-baa8-fdc288a7143b", "TermId": "7dc88ee7-8d74-42d5-91b1-dc973f9ff7ec", "CampusId": "69fe4158-6eaf-4d27-8c81-74806f770db3", "Sections": [{"Id": "9543319d-e7cd-432d-9714-6348794f5e32", "Crn": "22886", "ClassId": "c26b2d11-89d0-43a6-823e-efa348e7b6bc", "Type": "Lecture", "RegistrationStatus": "NotAvailable", "StartDate": "2023-01-09T05:00:00Z", "EndDate": "2023-04-29T04:00:00Z", "Capacity": 10, "Enrolled": 11, "RemainingSpace": -1, "WaitListCapacity": 0, "WaitListCount": 0, "WaitListSpace": 0, "Meetings": [{"Id": "35a1cab2-e24c-4c5d-a61f-32f809b02695", "SectionId": "9543319d-e7cd-432d-9714-6348794f5e32", "Type": "Lecture", "StartDate": "2023-01-09T05:00:00Z", "EndDate": "2023-04-29T04:00:00Z", "DaysOfWeek": "Tuesday, Thursday", "StartTime": "2023-01-22T16:30:00Z", "Duration": "PT50M", "RoomId": "5858fc64-ebb0-4f4d-8a27-13d05369dfe9"}]}]}]}, {"Id": "deac65b2-9bb4-49cb-afb7-084f5349fd97", "Number": "29900", "SubjectId": "a003a9c9-9484-462e-a546-fba3eb2b0470", "Title": "Exploring Place Pandemic", "CreditHours": 2.0, "Description": "Description:  Exploring Place is an examination of the cultural, social and historical dynamics that influence communities and relationships of a site.

How does a protein\u2019s amino acid sequence dictate its three-dimensional structure? FoldIt is an online game in which players determine the most stable folded structure of hypothetical proteins that have been predicted by unique computer algorithms to perform specific functions in the cell. Students in this course will be introduced to the mechanics of the FoldIt software to fold computer-predicted proteins into their native structures as well as design novel proteins that can bind and deactivate the Covid19 spike protein.

What was their purpose? Who created them, and how? Cats were sacred in Ancient Egypt, and some were mummified. Harming a cat could result in a harsh punishment. In this course students with an interest in these, and many other questions, will study the early origin of man\u2019s fascination with animals from the Paleolithic era, Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, and East and South Asia.  Particular attention will be paid to works of art that help demonstrate man\u2019s fascination with animals, and the course of hunting, herding, and domestication.  What is domestication, and how did it occur? This course is appropriate for students with no previous study of history or art history. What is required is an interest and curiosity in the subject.", "Classes": []}]}
