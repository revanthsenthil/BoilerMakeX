Partner Up!
Welcome to Partner Up!, a website designed to help students find study buddies in their classes. With Partner Up!, students can submit their schedules via screenshots or manually entering, and then search for other students who are also looking for study buddies in the same classes.

Getting Started
To get started with Partner Up!, you will need to have the following installed on your computer:

Flask (for the backend)

Once you have these installed, you can begin working on the website by cloning the repository and running the flask server.

Submitting Your Schedule
To submit your schedule, you can either take a screenshot of your schedule and upload it to the website, or you can manually enter your schedule by class and day. Once your schedule is submitted, you can begin searching for study buddies in your classes.

Searching for Study Buddies
To search for study buddies, simply go to the "Search" page on the website and select the classes you are looking for study buddies in. The website will then give you the email addresses of other students who are also looking for study buddies in those classes.
